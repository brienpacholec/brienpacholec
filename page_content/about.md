I reign from Buffalo, New York home of the Buffalo Bills & the world's best chicken wings! I graduated from Ithaca College in 2019 with a bachelor's degree in computer science. During my time as a Bomber, I played defensive tackle for the football team. I am currently wrapping up my master's of business in administration at Daemen College.

Currently, work at Daemen College as a full-stack web developer. In my current role, I am responsible for the development of our student & faculty web portal. I develop on the front-end of the stack using SCSS, Vue.JS, and HTML5. On the back-end of things, my days of development are spent utilizing MySQL, PHP, and Python.

Beyond my day-in-day-out, I love to stay busy. I am an avid weight lifter, recently a skydiver, and traveling hiker. In the summer of 2021, my girlfriend and I spent 7 days hiking through southern Utah at a few national parks (Zion, Capitol Reef, Bryce Canyon, Grand Staircase Escalante).

I do find time to relax and take a break! In my free time, I enjoy playing XBOX, grabbing some beers with my friends, reading some nonfiction, and binge-watching some anime.
