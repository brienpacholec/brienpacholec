Throughout my time as a web developer, I have worked on many exciting projects. From small minor tweaks and changes to established systems to leading development on large-scale systems like that of our COVID-19 Campus Clearance system. I am constantly looking for ways to improve UI/UX by utilizing feedback responses from our students and faculty. In my current role, my responsibilities have been extended through continuous development on our Apache Airflow server. Additionally, this role takes lead on all major system changes to our student/faculty portal.
