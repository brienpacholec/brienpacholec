* Developed ASP.NET systems for higher education.
* Created and analyzed reports utilizing Microsoft SQL Server and Informer Reporting Software.

My role in software development was primarily focused on backend processes for the college. Beyond managing and creating reports through Informer - my first main project was creating an Audit Database system. This system (created in Visual Studio utilizing ASP.NET in C#) would be used to track and document audits within our in-house and third-party systems.
